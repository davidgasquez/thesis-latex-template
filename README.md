# Thesis Latex Template

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This LaTeX template is designed to be used as skeleton for a standard thesis.

I am by no ways an expert with LaTeX so please, don't hesitate to open an issue
if you notice something wrong or with room for improvement.

## Quickstart
- Clone the Github repository.
- Make your thesis.
- Run `make` to generate the output file.

## Continuous Compilation
If you plan to use this I'd recommend to run `make dev` as it re-makes the
pdf file with any change.

## Linters
If [write-good] and [proselint] are installed, you can run `make lint` to get a
list of warnings and tips for improving the style. Those tools are naive linters
for English prose.
